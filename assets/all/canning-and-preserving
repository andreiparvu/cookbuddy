If you've never canned something before it can feel a little daunting at first. If you know someone who has canned and preserved foods before ask them to help walk you through it the first time. Although it's actually pretty simple once you've done it, it's very important to follow the steps for canning and preserving exactly to prevent spoilage of your food. If you fail to follow the instructions properly some very toxic, invisible bacteria can grow. Make sure you clean everything, follow the recommended boiling times, and follow each recipe that you want to preserve exactly. No substitutes!</p></div>\n<div itemprop=\"description\" class=\"description\">Rather than repeat these somewhat extensive instructions for each recipe, I will refer to this master set of steps that should be followed if you want to can and preserve food.
